A table with randomly filled data is presented. It is necessary to implement:

- pagination with a choice of the number of displayed elements on a single page
- sorting by clicking on any of the columns (ascending, descending, as it is). Sorting occurs only on one of the columns at a time
- full-text search (by any data from the table) with highlighting of found occurrences and filtering of rows that do not contain any occurrences of the searched phrase
